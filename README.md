4-Instruction Microprocessor Design in Verilog

A simple 4-instruction microprocessor designed in Verilog for the Logic Design course at Seoul National University. 
Project was implemented and tested on a custom FPGA board. 

Professor: Changun Lee

Features
* **4-Instruction Support:** The CPU can execute four basic instructions:
    * `ADD`: Adds two values.
    * `LOAD`: Loads a value from memory into a register.
    * `STORE`: Stores a value from a register into memory.
    * `JUMP`: Jumps to a specific instruction address.
* **Hardware:** Designed for and tested on a custom FPGA board
* **Output:** Computation results are displayed in hexadecimal on the board's dual seven-segment displays.

Programmed in Verilog

** files with 'T' at the back signify they were used for testing portion of the implementation.
